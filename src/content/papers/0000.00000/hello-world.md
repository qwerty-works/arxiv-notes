## What the paper claims

This is a placeholder.

## What’s actually new

Still placeholder.

## Structure takeaways (how to use AI better)

- Write constraints like a contract.
- Keep diffs small.

## Try this

```text
You are my assistant. Do not change architecture. Keep diff under 200 lines.
```

## Skeptic check

If it sounds too magical, it probably is.
