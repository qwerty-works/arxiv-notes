    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="subhead">A tiny newspaper for arXiv papers, written for builders who want the useful parts.</p>

    <h2>What you’ll get</h2>
    <p>
      Each post is a ~5-minute brief plus a “structure lens”: how this paper should change the way you
      design prompts, workflows, evals, and human-in-the-loop checks.
    </p>

    <h2>How posts are made (so we don’t hallucinate)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the arXiv <strong>HTML</strong> version end-to-end (for structure/sections).</li>
      <li>Also read the <strong>PDF</strong> (and pull figure captions/tables where relevant).</li>
      <li>If figures matter, we render/inspect them instead of guessing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we don’t do</h2>
    <p>
      No hype. No “this changes everything.” No 3,000-word throat clearing.
      Just claims, evidence, failure modes, and what to try next.
