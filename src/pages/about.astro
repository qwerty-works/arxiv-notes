    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="subhead">A tiny newspaper for arXiv papers, written for general curious humans.</p>

    <h2>What you’ll get</h2>
    <p>
      Each post distills one paper in ~5 minutes and extracts the practical takeaways:
      how you should structure prompts, workflows, context, interaction loops, and tool boundaries
      to get better outcomes with AI.
    </p>

    <h2>What we don’t do</h2>
    <p>
      No hype. No "this changes everything". No 3,000-word throat clearing.
      Just structure, takeaways, and what to try next.
